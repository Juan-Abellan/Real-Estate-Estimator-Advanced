# Real-Estate-Estimator-Advanced

## Background & Objectives
You will learn how to **approximate** solutions of a linear algebra problem that has no deterministic solution, in order to implement your first statistical estimator of real estate prices by hand!

## Data
We now have access to a database of 1000 flats! We can't solve the system of linear equation like we did in the previous challenge because our matrix is not square this time!

## Tools
For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
